# Synopses

This was created as a means to remember books I have read in the past. A simple deployed app with comforting, easy to use functionality. Look up a book if it is already in existence in the app, create it, or just look at the book which is already created.

Amazon books, Goodreads, Penguin books, Wikipidia, ISBNDB are all queried instantly to get all the data that I felt was possible in a limited amount of time.

Built with love over several weeks.
